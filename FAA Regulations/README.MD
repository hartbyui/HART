The date referred to in this document is 5-14-2024. 
As of this date this link can bring you to the FAA regulations for teathered and unteathered ballon flights: https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-101?toc=1. 
Also as of the above date these regulations are in Title 14; Chapter 1; Subchapter F; Part 101. So in the future somewhere around there in the regulations is a good place to start looking for regulatgions. 
If you at the website you generate a pdf of Part 101, and it has the same thing in parentheses: (up to date as of 5-10-2024), then the regulations have not changed.
