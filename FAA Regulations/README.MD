As of 5/14/2024 this link can bring you to the FAA regulations for teathered and unteathered ballon flights: https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-101?toc=1.
Also as of the above date these regulations are in Title 14; Chapter 1; Subchapter F; Part 101. So in the future somewhere around there in the regulations is a good place to start looking for regulatgions.
