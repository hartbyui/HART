            Current NOTAM number: <b>1-877-487-6867</b><br>
            When your ready to file the NOTAM, call the number above and tell them you would like to file a NOTAM<br>
            for a free unmanned baloon flight, Answer all questions asked. At the end of the call you will be given a NOTAM number<br>
            <u><b>Make sure to write this down</b></u>, if you did not get it all, ask them to repeat it.<br>
            They will then sign off by asking for your initals, they will then respond with theirs and hang up<br><br>
            These are a list of all questions the FAA agent may ask you.<br>
            What you will be asked will depend on who you get on the phone. 
            I have put a star(*) next to things you will always be asked.<br>
            Make sure to file the NOTAM 24hrs minimum before launch
            <u><b>unless</b></u> a critical time element is happening (northern lights, eclispe, etc.)<br><br>
            If you need to change anything about a NOTAM call the same number as above and say you need to update a NOTAM<br>
            they will ask for the NOTAM number, repeat that to them. They will then ask what you want to change. Once you complete<br>
            updating any information they will give you a new NOTAM number and sign off as the same as noted above.
